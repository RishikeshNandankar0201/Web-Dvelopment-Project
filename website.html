        <p class="sectionTag text-big"> About Cuisine</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Maharashtrian or Marathi cuisine is the cuisine of the Marathi people from the Indian state of Maharashtra. It has distinctive attributes, while sharing much with other Indian cuisines. Traditionally, Maharashtrians have considered their food to be more austere than others.
            Maharashtrian cuisine includes mild and spicy dishes. Wheat, rice, jowar, bajri, vegetables, lentils and fruit are dietary staples. Peanuts and cashews are often served with vegetables. Meat was traditionally used sparsely or only by the well off until recently, because of economic conditions and culture.
            
            The urban population in metropolitan cities of the state has been influenced by cuisine from other parts of India and abroad. For example, the Udupi dishes idli and dosa, as well as Chinese and Western dishes, are quite popular in home cooking, and in restaurants.
            
            Distinctly Maharashtrian dishes include ukdiche modak, aluchi patal bhaji, Kande pohe and Thalipeeth.</p>

        <p class="sectionTag text-big">Regular Meals</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Since they occupy a vast area with distinct geographical differences and food availability, the Marathi people from different regions have produced a diverse cuisine. The diversity extends to the family level because each family uses its own unique combination of spices and ingredients.The majority of Maharashtrians are not averse to eating meat, fish and eggs, however, the staple diet for most people is mostly lacto-vegetarian. Many communities such as the brahmins, or the varkari sect members only follow the lacto-vegetarian diet.

            The traditional staple food on Desh (the Deccan plateau) is usually bhakri, spiced cooked vegetables, dal and rice. However, North Maharashtrians and urbanites prefer roti or chapati, which is a plain bread made with wheat.
            
            In the coastal Konkan region, rice is the traditional staple food. Wet coconut and coconut milk are used in many dishes. Marathi communities indigenous to Mumbai and North Konkan have their own distinct cuisine.[note 1] In South Konkan, near Malvan, another independent cuisine developed called Malvani cuisine, which is predominantly non-vegetarian. Kombdi vade, fish preparations and baked preparations are more popular there.
            
            In the Vidarbha region, little coconut is used in daily preparations but dry coconut and peanuts are used in dishes such as spicy savjis, as well as in mutton and chicken dishes.
            
            Maharashtrian lacto-vegetarian dishes are based on five main classes of ingredients that include grains, legumes, vegetables, dairy products and spices.</p>

        <p class="sectionTag text-big">Lunch and Dinner</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Vegetarian lunch and dinner plates in urban areas carry a combination of:
            <li>
            1.Wheat flatbread such as round chapati or ghadichi poli (layered triangular chapati)</li>
            <li>2. Boiled rice</li>
            <li>3. Salad or koshimbir based on onions, tomatoes or cucumber</li>
            <li>4. Papad or related snacks such as sandge, kurdaya and sabudana papdya</li>
            <li>5. Dry or fresh chutney, mango or lemon pickles</li>
            <li>6. Aamti or varan soup based on toor dal, other dals or kadhi. When usal is part of the menu, the aamti may be omitted.</li>
            <li>7. Vegetables with gravy based on seasonal availability such as egg plants, okra, potatoes, or cauliflower</li>
            <li>8. Dry leafy vegetables such as spinach</li>
            <li>9. Usal based on sprouted or unsprouted whole legumes</li>
            Apart from bread, rice, and chutney, other items may be substituted. Families that eat meat, fish and poultry may combine vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes, with rice and chapatis remaining the staples. Vegetable or non-vegetable items are essentially dips for the bread or for mixing with rice.
            
            Traditional dinner items are arranged in a circular way. With salt placed at 12 o'clock, pickles, koshimbir and condiments are placed anti-clockwise of the salt. Vegetable preparations are arranged in a clockwise fashion with a sequence of leafy greens curry, dry vegetables, sprouted been curry (usalâ€‰) and dal. Rice is always on the periphery rather than in the center.</p>
